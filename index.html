                     <p>Devil’s Peak estate lies on the slopes just above the city centre, between Vredehoek and the Table Mountain National Park.Not only are the views up here over Table Bay superlative, but the suburb is not zoned for flats, townhouses or multi-dwelling units and, as such, is largely given over to smaller homes - certainly smaller than Vredehoek - and zealously guarded by residents, who regard Devil’s Peak as a sensitive area that will not benefit from any further development.Devil’s Peak is one of the major landmarks of Cape Town and forms part of the mountainous backdrop to the city. The distinctive peak lies to the left of Table Mountain with Lion’s Head and Signal Hill to the right of the table top - when looking at the mountain from the harbour. <a href="https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/devils-peak.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="read-more">Read More</a></p>

                        <p>Like Signal Hill, the walk to the top of Lions Head is popular with both tourists and locals alike. Generally the walk takes about 90 minutes and is fairly manageable although there are a few chains and ladders that one might need to negotiate along the way, especially as one nears the steeper sections of the climb.

                        The views of the city of Cape Town, Table Mountain and the beaches of Camps Bay and Clifton. are spectacular, and well worth the walk.
                        
                        For something a bit different, walk the route during full moon. It is best to start the walk during the early evening, watch the sunset and then walk back down by moonlight. It is advisable to carry a torch, water and a light sweater with you as temperatures can drop.<a href="https://www.sa-venues.com/things-to-do/westerncape/lions-head-walk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="read-more">Read More</a></p>
